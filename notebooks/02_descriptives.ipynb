    "The seasonal statistics show that the  winter, spring and summer cluster around the same average utilization levels, with means of roughly 11-14%. This suggests a broadly comparable demand across these seasons. \n",
    "In contrast, fall stands out clearly with an average utilization of around 20%. This is substantially higher than the other seasons and signal a distinct peak in charging activity during fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "The boxplot of the average utilization by season reinforces this picture. While the interquartile ranges for winter, spring, and summer overlap strongly and are centered around mid-single to low-double digit utilization, the fall box is shifted upward, with both its median and upper quartle at noticably higher levels. The implication of this is that not only occasional peak days but also typical fall days experiencehigher utilization, making fall structually busier rathern than being deiven by few outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scatterplot show how the seasonal trends play out over time. The data points of fall frequently reach higher utilization values, particularly in the pre-2020 phase and form dense clusters at eleveated levels compared to the other seasons. Even during later years, when ovveral utilization is lower, fall days still tend to populate the upper part of the seasonal cloud. This is consistent with the summary statistics and confirm that fall is the period of systematically strongest usage of charging stations."
